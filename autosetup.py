# Ground Control Autosetup Script
# This script completes all necessary steps for setup, or can be used as a reference in manual setup.

# There is one local dependency (isaacgym) that is outside this repo, you should download it and either
# place it in the same parent directory as 'ground_control' (meaning outside the repo) or manually install it
# via pip (by running 'pip install -e .' in isaacgym/python) and then run this script.

# By default, the script sets up everything necessary for train/play on sim, but not deployment. If you would like
# autosetup of deployment, you can run this script as 'python autosetup.py -d' or 'python autosetup.py --deploy', which
# will perform additional steps and re-installs the main repo at the end. With this option, you may be asked for the sudo
# password in order to install some dependencies from apt.

# The main script gets the arguments (parsed by argparse) and performs the entire setup, printing details along the way.
